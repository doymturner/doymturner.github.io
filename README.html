<h2>Some works</h2>

<h3>Cross Domain Connection Tool</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A few years back the difficulty of working with SSMS across mulitple domains in an org (in this case for a Gov Office) prompted me to look into a command line solution to the problem. I wrote myself a small PS script to deal with the problem. A couple of things quickly became apparent.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The need for this to work with multiple SSMS versions was real</li>
<li>Other people had the same issue</li>
<li>It might be fun to wrap this in something a little friendlier than a PS script.</li>
</ul>
