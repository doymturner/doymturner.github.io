## Projects and Demos

> Some publicly available goodies and non-sense. There are many others but they are (mostly) propriatary and out of my control. 

### Cross Domain Connection Tool *deprecated*

> A few years back the complexity of working with SSMS across mulitple domains prompted me to look for simplification. I wrote a small PS script to deal with the problem. A couple of things quickly became apparent:

- The need for this to work with multiple SSMS versions was real
- Other people had the same issue
- It might be fun to wrap this in something a little friendlier than a PS script.
