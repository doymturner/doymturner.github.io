## Some works
### Cross Domain Connection Tool
> A few years back the difficulty of working with SSMS across mulitple domains in an org (in this case for a Gov Office) prompted me to look into a command line solution to the problem. I wrote myself a small PS script to deal with the problem. A couple of things quickly became apparent.

- The need for this to work with multiple SSMS versions was real
- Other people had the same issue
- It might be fun to wrap this in something a little friendlier than a PS script.

[This happened](https://github.com/doymturner/CrossDomainConnectionTool) as a result.
